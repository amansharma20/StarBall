The weather made its own adjustments to the training process. It was supposed to be a lesson on the field, tactical, but because of the snow we worked in the hall.
              
              Now physical training is aimed at all muscle groups: both on the legs and on the shoulder girdle. And they breathed and sweated - in general, they did a good job.
              
              Training is training, but a game is a game, it has a lot more responsibility and a completely different job. We are very glad that we have already played the first match at a fairly good level, but there is still room for improvement.​
              
              Now we are consolidating what we already had in the first season and will try these components`,

            The score in the match was opened on the 36th minute, when a canopy from the right flank went into the Dynamo penalty area, where Emre Demir headed right into the goal. In the second half, the people of Kiev significantly updated the composition and began to dominate the field. Then, on 53 minutes, Popov equalized the score, successfully playing with his head on the rebound. On 77 minutes, Tsarenko put the White-Blues ahead, but nine minutes later the Turks bounced back thanks to an unexpected free kick from thirty meters away.
            
            A couple of minutes later, the same scandalous episode arose. Diallo rushed from the center of the field to the opponent's goal and shot past the goalkeeper into the goal, but the Senegalese could not celebrate the goal due to offside. This decision greatly outraged the Dynamo team, while the head coach of the team Igor Kostyuk himself ran onto the field to express his dissatisfaction.
            
            A few seconds later, a massive brawl began because of Diallo, who hit an Antalyaspor player in a non-game episode. The teams barely calmed down, and the referee decided not to finish the last few minutes of sparring.
            
            Dinamo U-19 — Antalyaspor U-19 2:2

            Russian mixed martial artist (MMA) Petr Yan entered the top ten fighters of the Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC), regardless of weight categories. The updated rating is available on the promotion website.
            
            Yang has moved up two spots and is now in ninth place. The current UFC welterweight champion, American Kamaru Usman, heads the rating.
            
            Yan's next fight will be in April against American Aljamain Sterling. Initially, the fighters were supposed to meet at the UFC tournament on October 30. However, the American withdrew from the fight. He was replaced by Cary Sandhagen, whom Yan defeated by unanimous decision to win the Interim UFC Bantamweight Championship.
            
            Yang lost the bantamweight championship belt in the spring of 2021 in a duel with Sterling. The Russian was defeated by inflicting an illegal blow on his opponent. In total, Jan has 16 wins with two defeats.`,

            “Preparing to go to the arena, I put on my suit and waited for the manager and coach, and suddenly I heard a surprised exclamation from them. I asked them what happened and they said they just got a letter from the UFC saying they are going to sue us for my manager talking to some guy named Nakisa.
            
            I asked them who this guy was and they said they didn't know him very well, but he was from Jake Paul's team. I asked them if he was a promoter and they said no. They didn’t say anything else so as not to distract me from the fight,” Ngannou said.
